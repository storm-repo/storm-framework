     * <p>If this scope is joined to an outer transaction (for example via {@link TransactionPropagation#REQUIRED}
     * or {@link TransactionPropagation#NESTED}), the callback is deferred to the outermost physical transaction's
     * commit. {@link TransactionPropagation#REQUIRES_NEW} scopes fire their own callbacks independently.</p>
     *
     * <p>The scope is uninstalled before the callback runs, so no transaction is active while it executes. A
     * database operation performed here runs in auto-commit, and a transactional block opened here starts a new
     * physical transaction rather than joining the one that just committed. That is what makes the callback the
     * place for work that must observe the committed state, or that must not be rolled back together with it,
     * such as publishing an event or invalidating a cache.</p>
     *
     * <p>Callbacks run synchronously, before the transactional block returns, so their duration is added to the
     * caller's. Work that can block for a long time, such as a write that contends with a batch job, belongs on a
     * background worker that the callback hands off to.</p>
     *
     * <p>Callbacks registered through {@link #onCommit(Runnable)}, {@link #onRollback(Runnable)} and
     * {@link #onCompletion(Consumer)} share one order: they execute in the order they were registered, skipping
     * the ones that do not apply to the outcome. If a callback throws, remaining callbacks still execute and the
     * failures are reported as a {@link TransactionCallbackException} whose cause is the first one, with the rest
     * attached to it as suppressed. That exception leaves the transactional block after the transaction has
     * already committed, so catch it to tell a failed side effect apart from a failed transaction.</p>
