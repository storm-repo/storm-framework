/**
 * Reads and retunes what the SQL log reports, while the application runs.
 *
 * <p>Both halves of the log answer a question that arises about a deployment that is misbehaving now, which is
 * the moment a restart costs the most: the performance log says what a call cost the database, and the slow
 * statement log names the execution that made it cost that. A threshold that can only be set at startup is a
 * threshold that is wrong when it matters, so both are read per unit of work and both are settable here.</p>
 *
 * <p>What cannot be set here is {@code storm.sql-log.performance.enabled}. It decides whether the request filter and the
 * entry-point proxies exist, and neither can be installed into a context that has already refreshed. An
 * application that wants the performance log reachable in production enables it and leaves the thresholds
 * high; lowering a threshold here then costs nothing until it is lowered. The slow statement log needs no such
 * plumbing and can be switched on from off.</p>
 *
 * <p>Registered as {@code stormsqllog}, and, like every actuator endpoint, only reachable once exposed through
 * {@code management.endpoints.web.exposure.include}. It reads and changes the diagnostic settings of a running
 * deployment, so it belongs behind the same authorization as the other write endpoints.</p>
 *
 * <p>A setting changed here holds until it is changed again or the application restarts; nothing is written back
 * to the configuration. The slow log learns what a shape typically costs while it runs, so lines reported shortly
 * after it is switched on carry no baseline. The slow threshold the performance log's duration is derived into is
 * read at startup, so retuning the performance threshold here leaves the slow threshold where it is; set both when
 * both are meant to move.</p>
