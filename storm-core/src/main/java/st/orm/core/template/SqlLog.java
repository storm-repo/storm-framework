/**
 * Records the statements a call executes, so a unit of work can be judged by what it cost the database.
 *
 * <p>A scope answers what a single call did as a whole: how many statements it took, which of them resolved
 * references rather than being asked for, and which statement carried the weight. That total is invisible from any
 * one statement.</p>
 *
 * <p>A scope covers whatever executes inside it, whichever repository, query builder or template issued the
 * statement, so it can wrap the entry point of a request rather than a single repository.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Cost when inactive is zero.</strong> A scope registers on the interceptor chain that every statement
 * already walks, so a statement executed with no scope open reads a single counter and stops. The recording cost
 * is paid only while a scope is open.</p>
 *
 * <p>A scope is bound to the thread that opened it, so it records the statements of a blocking call. Statements
 * issued after a suspension that resumed on another thread fall outside it.</p>
 *
 * <p>How summaries render — line width, call-site skips — is a property of the deployment, configured rather
 * than programmed: the {@code storm.sql_log.performance.line_width} and {@code storm.sql_log.call_site_skip} system
 * properties on a plain JVM, or the corresponding keys of the Spring and Ktor integrations.</p>
