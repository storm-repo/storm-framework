## Code Formatting

Storm uses [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) to enforce consistent code formatting across the project. Formatting is checked automatically in CI and can be enforced locally with a git pre-push hook.

- **Kotlin** is formatted with [ktlint](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint) (Kotlin coding conventions)
- **Java** is formatted with [Palantir Java Format](https://github.com/palantir/palantir-java-format) (4-space indentation)

### Auto-fix formatting

```bash
mvn spotless:apply
```

### Check formatting without modifying files

```bash
mvn spotless:check
```

### Set up the pre-push hook

To automatically check formatting before every push:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

## Code Guidelines

### General

- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Keep changes focused; one feature or fix per PR
- Add tests for new functionality

### Kotlin

- Use idiomatic Kotlin (data classes, extension functions, etc.)
- Prefer immutability
- Use coroutines for async operations
- Follow [Kotlin coding conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html)

### Java

- Use records for immutable data
- Leverage pattern matching where appropriate
- Follow standard Java naming conventions
- Use `Optional` for nullable return values

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure existing tests pass before submitting
- Use meaningful test names that describe the scenario

```bash
# Run all tests
mvn test

# Run tests for a specific module
mvn test -pl storm-kotlin
```

## Use of AI

AI tools (assistants, code generation, and similar) are welcome in your workflow. The condition is ownership: you are the author of what you submit and take full responsibility for it. Review, understand, and test any AI-assisted output as if you had written it yourself — the same correctness, style, and licensing standards apply.

Because the work is yours, do not add AI attribution to commits or pull requests — no `Co-authored-by:` trailers naming an AI, and no "Generated with …" notes.

## Submitting Changes

### Issues and Branch Naming

Not every change needs an issue first:

- **New features, API changes, or behavior changes:** open an issue first so the design can be discussed before you invest time in code.
- **Bug fixes, documentation, tests, CI/infra, chores, and dependency bumps:** open a PR directly. Link an existing issue if there is one, but you do not need to create one.

Name branches `<type>/<short-description>`, using the same types as our commit messages ([Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)):

- `feat/` — new functionality
- `fix/` — bug fixes
- `docs/` — documentation
- `ci/` — CI and build configuration
- `chore/` — tooling, dependencies, and housekeeping
- `perf/` / `refactor/` — performance or internal refactors

For example: `feat/composite-foreign-keys`, `fix/cli-regex-injection`, `docs/faq-typos`.

Link related issues from the PR description with `Fixes #123` or `Closes #123`, and GitHub will close them automatically on merge — there is no need to put the issue number in the branch name.

### Pull Request Process

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch** for your changes
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-change
   ```
3. **Make your changes** with clear, atomic commits
4. **Test** your changes thoroughly
5. **Push** to your fork
6. **Open a Pull Request** against the `main` branch

### PR Guidelines

- Provide a clear description of the changes
- Link related issues with `Fixes #123` / `Closes #123`
- Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized
- Respond to review feedback promptly

### Commit Messages

Write clear commit messages that explain *what* and *why*:

```
Add support for composite foreign keys

- Handle multiple column FKs in entity mapping
- Update metamodel generator for composite keys
- Add tests for various composite key scenarios

Fixes #123
```
