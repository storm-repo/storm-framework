/**
 * The MariaDB dialect.
 *
 * <h2>Row value comparison</h2>
 *
 * <p>MariaDB inherits {@link MySQLSqlDialect#rendersTupleComparison} unchanged: a row value tuple is rendered for
 * a multi-row list and nowhere else. MariaDB is the dialect that makes that choice necessary rather than merely
 * tidy, because its optimizer treats a row value comparison differently depending on the statement it sits in.
 * Measured on 10.5.22 and confirmed on 11.4.12, against a 118k-row table keyed on {@code (study_id, user_id)}:</p>
 *
 * <table border="1">
 *   <caption>MariaDB plan for each comparison shape</caption>
 *   <tr><th>Shape</th><th>As a tuple</th><th>As the expansion</th><th>Rendered as</th></tr>
 *   <tr><td>Single row of equality, SELECT</td><td>{@code const}, primary key, 1 row</td>
 *       <td>{@code const}, primary key, 1 row</td><td>Expansion</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>Single row of equality, UPDATE</td>
 *       <td>{@code index}, <em>no candidate key</em>, all rows — <strong>~7500x slower</strong></td>
 *       <td>{@code range}, 1 row</td><td>Expansion</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>Single row of equality, DELETE</td><td>{@code ALL}, all rows</td>
 *       <td>{@code range}, 1 row</td><td>Expansion</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>Multi-row list (500 keys)</td>
 *       <td>Materialized semi-join on {@code distinct_key} — <strong>~150x faster</strong></td>
 *       <td>500-branch OR</td><td><strong>Tuple</strong></td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>Ordering comparison</td><td>{@code ALL}, all rows</td>
 *       <td>{@code range}, primary key</td><td>Expansion</td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * <p>The SELECT row is what makes this easy to miss: the read path reduces the row value comparison to its
 * conjunction and takes the index, so the tuple looks harmless until it reaches a write. In an UPDATE or a DELETE
 * the reduction does not happen, no index is even considered, and every identified row costs a scan of the whole
 * table. A batch of keyed updates is then quadratic in the table, and because a scanning statement locks what it
 * examines, two such batches against one table deadlock rather than merely running slowly.</p>
 *
 * <p>The list row is the mirror image and the reason the tuple is kept for it.</p>
