/**
 * Auto-configuration that reports what each unit of work cost the database, and the single statement executions
 * that cost too much.
 *
 * <p>Opt in to the performance log with {@code storm.sql-log.performance.enabled=true}. Every way work enters the
 * application is a boundary: HTTP requests are wrapped by a servlet filter, and scheduled tasks and message
 * listeners by a proxy around the annotated entry-point method, so a worker without a web layer reports the same
 * way a web application does. For a narrower boundary, such as one service method, open a scope directly with
 * {@link st.orm.template.SqlLog}.</p>
 *
 * <p>The slow statement log, {@code storm.sql-log.slow.threshold=200ms}, needs no boundary: it reports each
 * execution whose database time exceeds the threshold, wherever it runs, and so applies with or without the
 * performance log. Left unset alongside {@code storm.sql-log.performance.enabled=true} it takes
 * {@code storm.sql-log.performance.threshold.duration} for its threshold, so a performance line that reports a slow call is
 * accompanied by the execution that made it slow.</p>
 *
 * <p>Everything the log reports with is applied at startup and stays changeable while the application runs,
 * through {@link StormSqlLogEndpoint} where the actuator is on the classpath. Only {@code enabled} is fixed
 * there: it decides whether the filter and the proxies exist, which a refreshed context cannot be given.</p>
