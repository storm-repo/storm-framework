# Getting Started

Storm is a modern SQL Template and ORM framework for Kotlin 2.0+ and Java 21+. It uses immutable data classes and records instead of proxied entities, giving you predictable behavior, type-safe queries, and high performance.

## Design Philosophy

Storm is built around a simple idea: your data model should be a plain value, not a framework-managed object. In Storm, entities are Kotlin data classes or Java records. They carry no hidden state, no change-tracking proxies, and no lazy-loading hooks. You can create them, pass them across layers, serialize them, compare them by value, and store them in collections without worrying about session scope, detachment, or side effects. What you see in the source code is exactly what exists at runtime.

This stateless design is a deliberate trade-off. Traditional ORMs like JPA/Hibernate give you transparent lazy loading and proxy-based dirty checking, but at the cost of complexity: you must reason about managed vs. detached state, proxy initialization, persistence context boundaries, and cascading rules that interact in subtle ways. Storm avoids all of this. It still performs [dirty checking](/dirty-checking), but by comparing entity state within a transaction rather than through proxies or bytecode manipulation. When you query a relationship, you get the result in the same query. There are no surprises.

Storm is also SQL-first. Rather than abstracting SQL away behind a query language (like JPQL) or a verbose criteria builder, Storm embraces SQL directly. Its SQL Template API lets you write real SQL with type-safe parameter interpolation and automatic result mapping. For common CRUD patterns, the type-safe DSL and repository interfaces provide concise, compiler-checked alternatives, but the full power of SQL is always available when you need it.

The framework is organized around three core abstractions:

- **Entity** is your data model. A Kotlin data class or Java record with a few annotations (`@PK`, `@FK`) that describe its mapping to the database. Storm derives table and column names automatically, so annotations are only needed for primary keys, foreign keys, and cases where the naming convention does not match.
- **Repository** provides CRUD operations and type-safe queries for a specific entity. You define an interface, write query methods with explicit bodies using the DSL, and Storm handles the rest. No magic method-name parsing, no hidden query generation.
- **SQL Template** gives you direct access to SQL with type-safe parameter binding and result mapping. You write real SQL, embed parameters and entity types directly in the query string, and get back typed results. This is the escape hatch when the DSL is not enough, and it is a first-class citizen in Storm, not an afterthought.

These abstractions share a common principle: explicit behavior over implicit magic. Every query is visible in the source code. Every relationship is loaded when you ask for it. Every transaction boundary is declared, not inferred. This makes Storm applications straightforward to debug, profile, and reason about.

## Choose Your Path

Storm supports two ways to get started. Pick the one that fits your workflow.

### AI-Assisted Setup

If you use an AI coding tool (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, or Codex), Storm provides rules, skills, and an optional database-aware MCP server that give the AI deep knowledge of Storm's conventions. The AI can generate entities from your schema, write queries, and verify its own work against a real database.

**1. Install the Storm CLI and run it in your project:**

```bash
npx @storm-orm/cli init
```

The interactive setup configures your AI tool with Storm's rules and skills, and optionally connects it to your development database for schema-aware code generation.

**2. Ask your AI tool to set up Storm:**

Once `storm init` has configured your tool, you can ask it to add the right dependencies, create entities from your database tables, and write queries. The AI has access to Storm's full documentation and your database schema.

For example:
- "Add Storm to this project with Spring Boot and PostgreSQL"
- "Set up Storm with Ktor and PostgreSQL"
- "Create entities for the users and orders tables"
- "Write a repository method that finds orders by status with pagination"

**3. Verify:**

Storm's AI workflow includes built-in verification. The AI can run `ORMTemplate.validateSchema()` to prove entities match the database and `SqlCapture` to inspect generated SQL, all in an isolated H2 test database before anything touches production.

See [AI-Assisted Development](ai.md) for the full setup guide, available skills, and MCP server configuration.

### Manual Setup

Follow these three steps in order for the fastest path from zero to a working application.

**1. Installation**

Set up your project with the right dependencies, build flags, and optional modules.

**[Go to Installation](installation.md)**

**2. First Entity**

Define your first entity, create an ORM template, and perform insert, read, update, and remove operations.

**[Go to First Entity](first-entity.md)**

**3. First Query**

Write custom queries, build repositories, stream results, and use the type-safe metamodel.
