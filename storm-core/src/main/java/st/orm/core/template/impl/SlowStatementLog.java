/**
 * Reports individual statement executions whose database time exceeds a threshold, under the
 * {@code st.orm.sql.slow} logger.
 *
 * <p>The statement log says what ran and a scope summary says what a call cost; neither names the one execution
 * that was slow. This log does, and it does so for every execution, inside a scope or not, on whatever thread it
 * runs: the decision is made where the statement returns from the database, on the thread that executed it.
 * That is what lets the call site be walked only for the executions that turned out slow, at no cost to the
 * rest, and what keeps the log independent of any request or coroutine boundary.</p>
 *
 * <p>Whether a statement is slow depends on its parameters as much as on its shape, so the line says which of the
 * two to look at. Each shape keeps a running baseline of what it typically costs and how many parameters it
 * typically binds; a slow line then reads either as an outlier of a normally fast shape (look at the values, or a
 * plan that changed) or as the usual cost of a uniformly slow one (look at the design). The parameter count is
 * always safe to print. Values themselves render only while the logger is at {@code TRACE}, the rule every Storm
 * SQL logger follows; the line stays at {@code WARN}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Enabled by a threshold: the {@code storm.sql_log.slow_statement} system property on a plain JVM, or the
 * corresponding keys of the Spring and Ktor integrations, which apply their configuration through
 * {@link #threshold(Duration)}. Without a threshold nothing is measured; a statement reads one volatile field and
 * moves on. Lines report at {@code WARN}, so raising {@code st.orm.sql} to {@code DEBUG} for per-statement
 * logging duplicates nothing here.</p>
 *
 * <p>Under a degraded database every statement is slow. Lines are rate-limited per shape
 * ({@code storm.sql_log.slow_statement_limit}, lines per shape per minute), and a line that follows suppressed
 * ones says how many it stands for, so the log names the shapes that suffer without drowning in them.</p>
