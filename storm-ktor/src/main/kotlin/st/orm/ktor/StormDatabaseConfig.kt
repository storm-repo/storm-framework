 * Configuration for an additional, named database of the [Storm] plugin.

 * configuration on [StormPluginConfig]. The database's template and repositories are exposed under the given name:
 * `orm("name")`, `repository<T>("name")`, and named dependency injection (`@Named("name")`).
 *
 * A named database inherits the plugin-level settings that express policy: the Storm configuration keys
 * (per key, `storm.databases.<name>.*` over `storm.*`), [exceptionMapper], [queryObserver], [sqlCommenter],
 * and [schemaValidation], each overridable in this block; the plugin-level entity callbacks, which apply in
 * addition to the callbacks declared here; and the [StormPluginConfig.autoRegisterRepositories] switch.
 * What identifies a database never inherits: its [dataSource], its [migration] hook, and its
 * [connectionProvider] and [transactionTemplateProvider], which define the database's transaction scope and
 * default to fresh per-database instances.
 *
 * The packages declared with [repositories] partition the application: repository interfaces and entity types under
 * these packages belong to this database. They are registered against this database's template, excluded from the
 * primary database's registration and schema validation, and validated against this database's schema instead.
