/**
 * Marker annotation for Storm's block-based SQL DSL.
 *
 * When two implicit receivers within the same block are annotated with this marker, the compiler hides the outer
 * receiver inside the inner block, preventing accidental scope leaking. For example, inside a `whereBuilder { }`
 * lambda nested within a `select { }` block, methods like `orderBy` or `limit` from the outer [SqlScope] are not
 * accessible without an explicit `this@select` qualifier.
 *
 * Applied to: [SqlScope], [WhereBuilder], [SubqueryTemplate], [TemplateContext].
