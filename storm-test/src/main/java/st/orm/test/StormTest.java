/**
 * Annotation for Storm integration tests.
 *
 * <p>Provides automatic {@link javax.sql.DataSource} creation using an H2 in-memory database (by default), SQL script
 * execution, and parameter injection for test methods. Test methods can declare parameters of type
 * {@link javax.sql.DataSource}, {@link SqlCapture}, or any type with a static {@code of(DataSource)} factory
 * method (such as {@code ORMTemplate}).</p>
 *
 * <p>Example usage:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * @StormTest(scripts = {"/schema.sql", "/data.sql"})
 * class MyTest {
 *
 *     @Test
 *     void myTest(ORMTemplate orm) {
 *         // orm is ready to use
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>The annotation is {@code @Inherited}: it may be placed on an abstract base class and applies to every concrete
 * subclass, each of which gets its own database.</p>
 *
 * <p>Each test runs inside a database transaction that is rolled back afterwards, so tests never observe each
 * other's writes. Set {@link #rollback()} to {@code false} for tests that need their writes to commit.</p>
 *
 * <p>Tests run on H2 by default. {@link #database()} runs them on the database the application deploys on instead,
 * in a Testcontainers-managed container that all test classes of the run share:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * @StormTest(database = POSTGRESQL, scripts = {"/schema.sql", "/data.sql"})
 * class VisitRepositoryTest {
 *
 *     @Test
 *     void findsVisitsByPet(ORMTemplate orm) {
 *         // running against PostgreSQL
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
