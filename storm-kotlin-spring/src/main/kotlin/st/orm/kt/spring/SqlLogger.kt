/**
 * Annotation for capturing and logging SQL statements and associated database table usage.
 *
 * Applying this annotation at either the function/method or class level will intercept execution via an aspect,
 * capturing, analyzing, and logging SQL statements and optionally the database tables involved.
 *
 * When applied at the class level, the annotation affects all methods within the class.
 *
 * Please note: If your repository interface has default-method implementations, you may need to compile with the Kotlin
 * compiler option `-Xjvm-default=all`. Without it, depending on the Kotlin version, Kotlin will emit those methods as
 * static helpers (not true JVM defaults), and the SQL-logger aspect canâ€™t intercept them.
 *
 * @param inlineParameters If true, SQL parameters are inlined into the logged SQL statements for better readability.
 * @param level Defines the logging level used when outputting captured SQL. Defaults to INFO.
 * @param name Optional logger name. If empty, the default logger of the intercepted class is used.
