/**
 * Returns a [Metamodel.Key] view of this metamodel. If this metamodel already implements [Metamodel.Key], it is
 * returned as-is; otherwise it is wrapped in a delegate that implements [Metamodel.Key].
 *
 * This is useful when the generated metamodel does not carry the [Metamodel.Key] marker, or when a column is known to
 * produce unique values in a particular query context (for example, a column that appears in a `GROUP BY` clause).
 *
 * **Important:** the caller is responsible for ensuring that the column produces unique values in the context where the
 * key is used. Using a non-unique column as a keyset pagination key will silently skip rows when duplicate values span
 * page boundaries.
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```
 * val key = User_.id.key()
 * ```
 *
 * @see Metamodel.key
