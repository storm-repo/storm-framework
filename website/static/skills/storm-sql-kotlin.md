Help the user write Storm SQL Templates using Kotlin.
Ask what query they need and why QueryBuilder does not suffice.

**SQL Templates are an escape hatch — use them only when there is no code-based alternative.** Regular joins, filtering, ordering, and pagination are all expressible through the QueryBuilder API (/storm-query-kotlin). Using SQL templates for things the QueryBuilder can express defeats the purpose of the ORM.

## When to use SQL Templates

SQL Templates exist for two scenarios:

**1. Template fragments** — a single clause (SELECT, HAVING) needs SQL that QueryBuilder cannot express, but the rest of the query is code-based. This is the most common case:
```kotlin
// Prefer code over templates — use templates only for expressions QueryBuilder can't produce
orm.entity(City::class)
    .select(CityUserCount::class) { "${City::class}, COUNT(*)" }
    .leftJoin(User::class).on(City::class)
    .groupBy(City_.id)
    .resultList
```

**2. Full SQL templates** — the entire query is custom SQL. This is truly a last resort for queries that cannot be composed with the QueryBuilder at all:
- CTEs (`WITH` clauses)
- `UNION` / `INTERSECT` / `EXCEPT`
- Window functions (`ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `LAG`, `LEAD`)
- Database-specific syntax

Even in full SQL templates, users still benefit from bind variables (`$value`) and metamodel references (`${Entity_.field}`).

**Do NOT use SQL Templates for:**
- Regular joins — use `innerJoin()`, `leftJoin()`, etc. on QueryBuilder
- Filtering — use `where()` with metamodel predicates or convenience methods (`findAll`, `find`)
- Ordering — use `orderBy()`, `orderByDescending()`
- Pagination, scrolling — use `page()`, `scroll()`
- Simple CRUD — use `find`, `findAll`, `remove`, `removeAll`, `insert`, `update`

**Inside SQL templates, always use metamodel references** (`${User_.email}`, `${City_.id}`) instead of hardcoding column names. This keeps queries type-safe and refactor-proof. Only use `${unsafe("raw sql")}` when there is truly no metamodel equivalent.

**FK path references:** Use `${User_.city.country}` (resolves to the FK column, e.g., `country_id`) rather than `${User_.city.country.id}` (resolves to the PK column on the joined table). The shorter form is preferred — it references the FK directly without requiring a join.

Requires the Storm compiler plugin. With the compiler plugin, use standard Kotlin `${}` interpolation inside a lambda — the plugin automatically wraps all interpolations for safe parameter binding:

```kotlin
val users = orm.query { """
    SELECT ${User::class}
    FROM ${User::class}
    WHERE ${User_.email} = $email
      AND ${User_.city.country.code} = $countryCode
""" }.resultList<User>()
```

Template elements:
- `${User::class}` in SELECT: full column list with aliases
- `${User::class}` in FROM: table + auto-JOINs for all @FK fields
- `${User_.email}`: column reference with correct alias
- `$email`: parameterized bind variable (SQL injection safe)
- `${from(User::class, autoJoin = false)}`: FROM without auto-joins
- `${table(User::class)}`: table name only (for subqueries)
- `${select(User::class, SelectMode.PK)}`: only PK columns
- `${column(User_.email)}`: explicit column with alias
- `${unsafe("raw sql")}`: raw SQL (use with caution)

## Aggregate example — the primary use case

Define a plain data class for the result shape, then use a SQL Template for the aggregate:

```kotlin
/**
 * Query result shape: user count per city. Not backed by a database table
 * or view, so it is a plain data class — deliberately not a Data type.
 */
data class CityUserCount(val city: City, val userCount: Long)

// Use select() with custom return type + minimal SQL template for the aggregate only
val cityCounts = orm.entity(City::class)
    .select(CityUserCount::class) { "${City::class}, COUNT(*)" }
    .leftJoin(User::class).on(City::class)
    .groupBy(City_.id)
    .resultList
```

The join, grouping, and result retrieval are all code-based. Only the `COUNT(*)` aggregate — which QueryBuilder cannot express — uses a SQL template fragment. This keeps the template to the absolute minimum.

Storm maps the result columns positionally onto the result type's components — entity components, `Ref<T>` components, and scalars all work without any marker interface. Do not implement `Data` on result types — it is reserved for table-backed types, and a `Data` result type would be picked up by schema validation (requiring `@DbIgnore` to suppress).

**`Ref<T>` in result types:** When a SELECT clause references a FK field (`${User_.city}`) rather than a full entity (`${City::class}`), use `Ref<T>` in the result type — not the raw ID type and not the full entity. `Ref<City>` maps correctly to the FK column value. Use the full entity type only when selecting all its columns via `${City::class}`.

All interpolated values become bind parameters. SQL injection safe by design.

**Note:** `Query.resultList` (Kotlin property, no type parameter) returns `List<Array<Any>>` — raw rows. For typed results, use the reified extension `query.resultList<T>()` (`import st.orm.template.resultList`) or `query.getResultList(T::class)`. Reified counterparts also exist for `singleResult<T>()`, `optionalResult<T>()`, `resultStream<T>()`, and `resultFlow<T>()`. This is different from QueryBuilder's `.resultList` which returns `List<R>` already typed to the query's result type.

Critical rules:
- **Always use lambdas, never `TemplateString.raw()`**: Template expressions should always be written as lambdas (`{ "..." }`) so the compiler plugin can process them. Never construct `TemplateString.raw("...")` manually.
- **`${}` interpolation with the compiler plugin**: The Storm compiler plugin automatically wraps all `${}` interpolations inside template lambdas. You do NOT need to call `t()` manually — just use standard Kotlin string interpolation. The `t()` function only exists as a fallback for projects without the compiler plugin.
- **Metamodel navigation depth**: Multiple levels of navigation are allowed on the root entity. However, joined (non-root) entities can only navigate one level deep. If you need deeper navigation from a joined entity, explicitly join the intermediate entity:
  ```kotlin
  // ❌ Wrong - two levels from joined entity
  orm.entity<Role>()
      .select(RoleSummary::class) { "..." }
      .innerJoin(UserRole::class).on(Role::class)
      .having { "COUNT(DISTINCT ${UserRole_.user.city}) > 1" }

  // ✅ Correct - explicitly join intermediate, then one level
  orm.entity<Role>()
      .select(RoleSummary::class) { "..." }
      .innerJoin(UserRole::class).on(Role::class)
      .innerJoin(User::class).on(UserRole::class)
      .having { "COUNT(DISTINCT ${User_.city}) > 1" }
  ```

Advanced patterns:
- Subqueries: use `table()` for inner FROM, `column()` for inner columns
- Correlated subqueries: use `column(field, INNER)` / `column(field, OUTER)` for alias scoping
- CTEs: write standard WITH clause, reference types normally
- UNION: combine multiple query blocks

## Verification

After writing SQL templates, write a test using `@StormTest` and `SqlCapture` to verify that schema, generated SQL, and intent are aligned.

Tell the user what you are doing and why: explain that `SqlCapture` records every SQL statement Storm generates. The goal is not to test Storm itself, but to verify that the SQL template produces the result the user intended — correct tables joined, correct grouping, correct aggregation. This is Storm's verify-then-trust pattern.

```kotlin
// Leading "/" resolves scripts from the classpath root (src/test/resources/).
@StormTest(scripts = ["/schema.sql", "/data.sql"])
class CityCountQueryTest {
    @Test
    fun citiesWithUserCounts(orm: ORMTemplate, capture: SqlCapture) {
        val results = capture.execute {
            orm.query { """
                SELECT ${City::class}, COUNT(*)
                FROM ${City::class}
                LEFT JOIN ${User::class} ON ${User_.city} = ${City_.id}
                GROUP BY ${City_.id}
            """ }.resultList<CityCount>()
        }
        // Verify intent: one row per city, each with a user count.
        assertEquals(1, capture.count(Operation.SELECT))
        assertFalse(results.isEmpty())
        assertTrue(results.all { it.count >= 0 })
    }
}
```

Run the test. Show the user the captured SQL and explain how it aligns with the intended behavior. If a query produces unexpected SQL or the right approach is unclear, ask the user for feedback before changing the query.

The test can be temporary — verify and remove, or keep as a regression test. Ask the user which they prefer.
