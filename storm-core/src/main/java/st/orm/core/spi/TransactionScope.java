/**
 * A pending transaction scope that binds to the first ORM template that executes inside it.
 *
 * <p>A scope is opened by the transaction API before the transactional block runs, carrying only the requested
 * transaction options. No transaction subsystem is selected at that point. The scope is <em>materialized</em> by the
 * first template that acquires a connection inside the block: that template's
 * {@link TransactionTemplateProvider} opens the actual transaction with the scope's options. Subsequent executions
 * by templates configured with the <em>same provider instance</em> join the materialized transaction; executions by
 * templates configured with a different provider fail fast, since a single commit cannot span two transaction
 * subsystems.</p>
 *
 * <p>Scopes nest: a scope opened while another scope is active joins or suspends the outer transaction according to
 * its propagation, evaluated by the owning provider at materialization time. A scope that is never materialized
 * completes as a no-op, propagating a buffered rollback-only mark to its parent when its propagation joins the outer
 * transaction.</p>
 *
 * <p>The current scope is tracked per thread via {@link #holder()}; coroutine or executor integrations propagate it
 * across threads by installing the scope in the holder for the duration of a task.</p>
