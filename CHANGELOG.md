## [1.13.0] - 2026-07-31

Feature release: write sets, GraalVM native images, the Storm Gradle plugin, Java transaction parity, and Micrometer observability.

- Added write sets (`orm.writeSet()`, Kotlin also `orm.writeSet { }`): one write action over a mixed-type collection of entities, ordered by foreign key dependencies and batched per type, with generated keys propagated by instance identity. `insert` and `upsert` extend the passed entities with their discovered members, the unsaved referenced entities picked up transitively (insert discovery); `update` and `remove` write exactly what is passed. Entities go in as varargs or any `Iterable`; `AndFetch` variants return the persisted state.
- Added `getResultGroupedBy` / `getResultGroupedByRef` query terminals: the one-to-many read grouped during hydration in a single query, compile-time typed through the new `TypedMetamodel`.
- Added navigation through `Ref` foreign keys in queries: filter, order, and select through a reference with the metamodel (`User_.city.country.name`), with the join for the referenced table materialized on demand while the root still selects the reference as its foreign key column. Nodes beyond a reference are navigation-only (the new `Navigable`) and are accepted by `where`, `orderBy`, `groupBy`, `having`, and selected columns, so value operations do not compile against them, while the reference node itself stays value-extractable for `getResultGroupedByRef`. A path may cross more than one reference across distinct tables. The referenced table can also be named by type instead of by path: selecting it or joining onto it materializes the same join. The target's primary key is part of the reference, so reaching it resolves to the foreign key column and needs no join, matching both `Ref.id()` and the column an entity foreign key resolves its primary key to. A reference that returns to a table already on the path joins that table to itself, each occurrence under its own alias, so a self-reference is navigable. The typed metamodel navigates a cycle two hops deep, because generated metamodels construct their children eagerly; the query engine has no depth limit, so deeper cyclic paths are named as strings.
- Added GraalVM native image support: reachability metadata, Spring AOT hints and AOT-participating repository scanning for Spring Boot; a storm-core GraalVM feature driven by the compile-time type index covers Ktor and plain JVM applications.
- Added the Storm Gradle plugin (`id("st.orm")`): imports the BOM, adds the language-path dependencies, wires the metamodel processor and the matching compiler-plugin variant, and sets the preview flags; configuration-cache compatible.
- Added programmatic transactions for Java (`Transactions.transaction(...)`) with the semantics of Kotlin's `transaction { }`, a shared transaction vocabulary in storm-foundation, and a Spring bridge that joins `@Transactional` transactions.
- Added query and transaction observability: `storm.query` and `storm.transaction` Micrometer Observations (new storm-micrometer module), auto-bound by the Spring Boot starters and the Ktor plugin, with opt-in OpenTelemetry database semantic conventions and trace-context SQL comments.
- Added `@EnableStormRepositories`, the `@DataStormTest` test slice (new storm-spring-boot-test-autoconfigure module), and shared starter auto-configurations; SQL failures now translate to Spring's `DataAccessException` hierarchy.
- Added to the Ktor plugin: repositories and the template through Ktor's built-in dependency injection, multiple databases via `database("name") { }`, and the `transactional { }` route DSL.
- Changed: framework integration points are instance-scoped. `ORMTemplate.builder(...)` composes `connectionProvider`, `transactionTemplateProvider`, `exceptionMapper` and `queryObserver`; `transaction { }` binds to the first template used inside the block; ambiguous provider resolution fails fast; templates never silently enlist in Spring transactions based on classpath presence.
- Changed: models are null-marked by default, aligning Java with Kotlin and JSpecify. Nullable annotations are load-bearing: a bare `@FK` joins with an INNER JOIN, `@Nullable @FK` with a LEFT JOIN.
- Changed: records are constructed through generated instantiators instead of reflection, removing the last reflective call from row mapping; leaner read and transaction hot paths.
- Changed: the Spring repository scanning engine is single-sourced in storm-spring with the Kotlin bindings in `st.orm.spring.kotlin`; one starter per application; Ktor upgraded to 3.2.3.
- Removed `@EnableTransactionIntegration`, the Spring `ServiceLoader` providers and reflective probes, and `storm-ktor-koin` (Ktor's built-in dependency injection is the supported path; the docs include the Koin recipe).
- Fixed the dynamic proxy interface order of monitored resources (deterministic, keeping GraalVM proxy registrations valid); hardened schema metadata queries and `Ref` deserialization.

## [1.12.1] - 2026-07-12

- Fixed metamodel references to components of compound primary keys resolving to the underlying columns.
- Fixed repository lookups by a `Ref` primary key (`Entity<Ref<T>>`): the reference was bound instead of the key it carries.
- Website and documentation updates.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-07-06

Feature release centered on the reified Kotlin query API. Breaking changes are accepted with no deprecation shims (1.12 policy).

- `QueryBuilder`, `JoinBuilder`, and `TypedJoinBuilder` are now abstract classes (were interfaces) so they can host reified members; recompile against 1.12.
- Schema validation now defaults to `fail` in the Spring Boot starters and the Ktor plugin; set `storm.validation.schema_mode` / `schemaMode` to `warn` or `none` to relax.
- Added a reified Kotlin query API: reified joins (`innerJoin<Rating>().on<Movie>()`, `innerJoin<Owner, Pet>()`), selects (`select<R, _, _>`, `selectFrom<T, R>`), repository lookup (`entity<T, ID>()`), and `Query` result terminals (`resultList<T>()`, `resultFlow<T>()`, and friends).
- Added `findBy` / `getBy` / `findAllBy` repository shortcuts (and `Ref` variants) for Java 21.
- Added the `storm-ktor-koin` module: `Application.stormModule()` bridges the ORM template and auto-registered repositories into Koin.
- Ktor: repositories auto-register when the `Storm` plugin is installed (`stormRepositories { }` is now optional); added a `migration { }` hook that runs before schema validation.
- Foreign keys now follow key chains, resolving to the referenced key's columns for dependent one-to-one relationships; FK columns are schema-validated through the chain.
- Dependency-aware join ordering fixes forward alias references that PostgreSQL rejected when outer joins are present; JSpecify `@NonNull` is now recognized for record-component nullability.
- Typed joins onto projections resolve by table match; ambiguous foreign-key joins now fail fast with a descriptive error instead of a silent first match.
- Fixed `@Json` binding to PostgreSQL `jsonb`, H2 natural-key upserts, and `@StormTest` script splitting on semicolons inside comments and literals.
- Spring Boot 4 auto-configuration compatibility.

## [1.11.6] - 2026-07-01
- Kotlin 2.4 support: added the `storm-compiler-plugin-2.4` variant built against the Kotlin 2.4.0 compiler API.
- Fixed `@Convert` on an embedded (`@Inline`) component field failing on save.

## [1.11.5] - 2026-06-27

## [1.11.4] - 2026-06-27
- Improved handling of `NULL` for optional results in `Query` and `QueryBuilder` (Java and Kotlin) so optional single-result lookups behave consistently.
- Optimized object mapping for value types, reducing per-row mapping overhead.

## [1.11.3] - 2026-05-30
- Added `validateSchema(Predicate<...>)` / `validateSchemaOrThrow(...)` overloads on `ORMTemplate`.
- Added `validateAndReport(Predicate, strict)` / `validateReportAndThrow(...)` on `SchemaValidator` for filter-based validation.

## [1.11.2] - 2026-04-09
- Added the `storm db` command group for managing a global database connection library.
- Added multi-database MCP support (`storm mcp add/list/remove`).
- Added optional read-only data access via the `select_data` MCP tool.

## [1.11.1] - 2026-04-01
- Added `Slice<R>` as the common base for `Window` (cursor-based scrolling) and `Page` (offset pagination).
- Added `findAllRef()` on `EntityRepository` / `ProjectionRepository`.
- Added `select(predicate)` / `selectRef(predicate)` convenience methods.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-03-27
