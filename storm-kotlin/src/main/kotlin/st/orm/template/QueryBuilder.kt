/**
 * A fluent builder for constructing type-safe SELECT and DELETE queries using the entity graph and metamodel.
 *
 * The `QueryBuilder` provides a composable, chainable API for building SQL queries without writing raw SQL.
 * It supports joins, WHERE clauses with type-safe metamodel paths, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, LIMIT/OFFSET,
 * row locking (FOR SHARE/FOR UPDATE), and result retrieval as flows, lists, or single results.
 *
 * Instances are obtained from an [st.orm.repository.EntityRepository] or
 * [st.orm.repository.ProjectionRepository] via their `select()`, `selectCount()`, or
 * `delete()` methods, or from a [QueryTemplate] via `selectFrom()` and `deleteFrom()`.
 *
 * ## Example: Select with type-safe WHERE clause
 * ```kotlin
 * val users = userRepository
 *     .select()
 *     .where(User_.address.city.name eq "Sunnyvale")
 *     .orderBy(User_.email)
 *     .limit(10)
 *     .resultList
 * ```
 *
 * ## Example: Join with reified type arguments
 * ```kotlin
 * val users = userRepository
 *     .select()
 *     .innerJoin<Order>().on<User>()
 *     .resultList
 * ```
 *
 * ## Example: Delete with WHERE clause
 * ```kotlin
 * val deleted = userRepository
 *     .delete()
 *     .where(User_.email.isNull())
 *     .executeUpdate()
 * ```
 *
 * ## Immutability
 * `QueryBuilder` is immutable: every builder method (such as `where()`, `orderBy()`,
 * `limit()`, etc.) returns a *new* instance with the modification applied, leaving the original
 * unchanged. If you call a builder method and ignore the return value, the change is silently lost.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * // WRONG - the where clause is lost because the return value is discarded:
 * val builder = userRepository.select()
 * builder.where(User_.active eq true)  // returns a new builder, but it's ignored
 * builder.resultList                   // executes without the WHERE clause
 *
 * // CORRECT - chain the calls or capture the returned builder:
 * val results = userRepository.select()
 *     .where(User_.active eq true)
 *     .resultList
 * ```
 *
 * @param T the type of the table being queried.
 * @param R the type of the result.
 * @param ID the type of the primary key.
 * @see st.orm.repository.EntityRepository
 * @see st.orm.repository.ProjectionRepository
 * @see QueryTemplate

     * table but not its key, so the id is a star projection and [WhereBuilder.whereId] has nothing to match against.

     * This is the ref-based variant of [resultGroupedBy]: the map keys are [Ref] instances, which are compared by
     * primary key, keeping map lookups constant-cost regardless of the size of the group record.
     *
     * The behavior of the keys follows how the foreign key is declared on the record:

     * - **Entity field** (for example `@FK val owner: Owner`): the referenced record is fetched eagerly, as part
     *   of the query's auto-joined graph, and is materialized with each result. The keys are *loaded* refs
     *   wrapping that record: [Ref.getOrNull] returns it directly, without touching the database.
     * - **Ref field** (for example `@FK val pet: Ref<Pet>`): the referenced record is fetched lazily; the query
     *   reads only the foreign key column, without joining or fetching the referenced table. The keys are the
     *   *unloaded* refs produced by the query, carrying just the primary key. When the records are needed, fetch
     *   them afterwards in a single query with `findAllByRef(map.keys)`:
