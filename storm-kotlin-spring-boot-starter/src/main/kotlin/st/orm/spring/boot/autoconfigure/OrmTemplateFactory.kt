/**
 * Composes fully integrated [ORMTemplate]s for the data sources of a multi-database application.
 *
 * Each created template carries the same Spring integration the auto-configured single template does, driven
 * by the same `storm.*` properties: the Spring-aware connection and transaction template providers, SQL
 * failure translation to Spring's `DataAccessException` hierarchy, query and transaction observations, and
 * trace-context SQL comments. The observations resolve their semantic conventions against the given data
 * source and, when a [database] name is given, carry it as the low-cardinality `storm.database` key value, so
 * the templates stay separable in dashboards.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * @Bean
 * fun orderTemplate(factory: OrmTemplateFactory) = factory.create(orderDataSource, "orders")
 * ```
 *
 * The [customize] block runs after the integration is composed, so application-specific composition, such as
 * a table name resolver, applies on top without the application touching the integration SPI. A template that
 * needs a different integration altogether defines it in the block, overriding what the factory set.
 *
