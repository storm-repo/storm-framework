 * <p>{@link Metamodel} extends {@code Navigable} and adds the value-based operations ({@code getValue}, {@code isSame},

 * referenced entity is not loaded, so such a path is {@code Navigable} (queryable) but not a full {@code Metamodel}
 * (not value-extractable). Query methods that only need to locate a column accept {@code Navigable}; methods that read
 * a value from a record (for example {@code getResultGroupedBy}) require a {@code TypedMetamodel}, so applying them to a
 * reference-crossing path fails to compile rather than at runtime.</p>
