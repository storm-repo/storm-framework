/**
 * A builder for specifying the ON condition of a JOIN clause using a type-safe entity relation or a custom expression.
 *
 * `TypedJoinBuilder` extends [JoinBuilder] and is returned by the join methods on [QueryBuilder] that accept an
 * entity class. In addition to the template-based [JoinBuilder.on] method, it provides an [on] method that accepts
 * a [KClass] to resolve the join condition automatically based on the foreign key relationships defined in the
 * entity graph.
 *
 * ## Example: Automatic join resolution
 * ```kotlin
 * val users = userRepository
 *     .select()
 *     .innerJoin(Order::class).on(User::class)
 *     .getResultList()
 * ```
 *
 * @param T the type of the table being queried.
 * @param R the type of the result.
 * @param ID the type of the primary key.
 * @see JoinBuilder
 * @see QueryBuilder
