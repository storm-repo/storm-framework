/**
 * A weak interner that ensures canonical instances of objects while holding them weakly to permit garbage collection.
 *
 * <p>This class uses a dual-path interning strategy optimized for different object types:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Entities</b>: Keyed by concrete type and primary key for efficient lookup. Entities are stored with
 *       {@link ReferenceQueue}-based cleanup to ensure stale entries are removed when entities are garbage
 *       collected.</li>
 *   <li><b>Non-entities</b>: Uses object equality-based lookup via {@link WeakHashMap}, which provides automatic
 *       cleanup when objects are no longer strongly referenced.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The primary key-based lookup for entities avoids potentially expensive deep equality checks on complex entity
 * objects, while maintaining correct identity semantics (same type and primary key = same canonical instance).</p>
 *
 * <p>Weak references are cleared only when their referent is no longer strongly reachable, which makes interning a
 * guarantee rather than a best-effort optimization: as long as a caller retains a strong reference to an interned
 * instance, later equivalent objects resolve to that same instance. A caller in a position to compare two duplicates
 * necessarily still holds the first one, which is exactly what keeps its entry alive, so duplicates can never be
 * observed as distinct instances.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class is not thread-safe. A new instance is expected to be created for each result set processing call,
 * ensuring that interning is scoped to a single query execution.</p>
