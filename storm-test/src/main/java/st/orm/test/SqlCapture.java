/**
 * Captures the SQL statements an action executes.
 *
 * <p>Statements are recorded around execution, so each carries what caused it, its bound parameter values, and how
 * long it took, and a statement that is built but never run is not captured. Statements accumulate across multiple
 * {@link #record}, {@link #execute}, or {@link #executeThrowing} calls; use {@link #clear()} to reset between
 * captures.</p>
 *
 * <p>The capture is bound to the thread that runs the action and to the contexts Storm carries it into, such as a
 * {@code transaction} block; it does not follow work handed to another thread or coroutine outside those contexts.
 * Recording itself is safe from any thread a carried context reaches. Kotlin coroutine code records through the
 * suspending {@code recording} extension of the {@code storm-kotlin-test} module, which follows the coroutine across
 * the threads it resumes on.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Testing only.</strong> Captured statements retain their bound parameter values, which may be
 * sensitive (credentials, personal data). This class lives in the test-scoped {@code storm-test} module; do
 * not route captured statements to logs or external systems from production code.</p>

 * @since 1.9
