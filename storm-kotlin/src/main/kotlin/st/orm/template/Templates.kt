/**
 * The `Templates` interface provides a collection of static methods for constructing SQL query elements
 * and creating ORM repository templates. It serves as a central point for building SQL queries or getting access to
 * repositories that can interact with databases in a type-safe and manner, supporting both JPA and JDBC.
 *
 * This interface includes methods for generating SQL clauses such as `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`,
 * `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`, as well as utility methods for working with parameters,
 * tables, aliases, and more.
 *
 * Additionally, the `Templates` interface provides methods to create [ORMTemplate]
 * instances for use with different data sources like JPA's [EntityManager], JDBC's [DataSource], or
 * [Connection].
 *
 * ## Using Templates
 *
 * Define the records to use them to construct the query using templates:
 * ```
 * data class City(
 *     id: Int = 0
 *     name: String,
 *     population: Long
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * ```
 * data class User(
 *     id: Int = 0,
 *     name: String,
 *     age: Int,
 *     birthDate: LocalDate,
 *     street: String,
 *     postalCode: String,
 *     cityId: Int
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * ### Create
 *
 * Insert a user into the database. The template engine also supports insertion of multiple entries by passing an
 * array (or list) of objects or primary keys. Alternatively, insertion can also be executed in batch mode using
 * [st.orm.BindVars].
 * ```
 * val user = ...
 * ORM(dataSource).query { """
 *     INSERT INTO ${t(User::class)}
 *     VALUES ${t(user)}
 * """ }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Read
 *
 * Select all users from the database that are linked to City with primary key 1. The value is passed to the
 * underling JDBC or JPA system as variable. The results can also be retrieved as a stream of objects by using
 * [Query.getResultStream].
 * ```
 * val users: List<User> = ORM(dataSource).query { """
 *     SELECT ${t(User::class)}
 *     FROM ${t(User::class)}
 *     WHERE ${t(User::class)}.city_id = {1}"""
 * }
 * .getResultList(User::class);
 * ```
 *
 * ### Update
 *
 * Update a user in the database. The template engine also supports updates for multiple entries by passing an
 * array or list of objects. Alternatively, updates can be executed in batch mode by using [st.orm.BindVars].
 * ```
 * val user = ...
 * ORM(dataSource).query { """
 *     UPDATE ${t(User::class)}
 *     SET ${t(user)}
 *     WHERE ${t(user)}
 * """ }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Delete
 *
 * Delete user in the database. The template engine also supports updates for multiple entries by passing an
 * array (or list) of objects or primary keys. Alternatively, deletion can be executed in batch mode by using
 * [st.orm.BindVars].
 * ```
 * val user = ...
 * ORM(dataSource).query { """
 *     DELETE FROM ${t(User::class)}
 *     WHERE ${t(user)}
 * """ }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Howto start
 *
 * The `Templates` interface provides static methods to create [ORMTemplate] instances based on your data source:
 *
 * ### Using EntityManager (JPA)
 * ```
 * val entityManager = ...
 * val orm = Templates.ORM(entityManager)
 * ```
 *
 * ### Using DataSource (JDBC)
 * ```
 * val dataSource = ...
 * val orm = Templates.ORM(dataSource)
 * ```
 *
 * ### Using Connection (JDBC)
 *
 * **Note:** The caller is responsible for closing the connection after usage.
 *
 * ```
 * val connection = ...
 * val orm = Templates.ORM(connection)
 * ```
