/**
 * Provides a generic interface with CRUD operations for entities.
 *
 * <h1>Using Entity Repositories</h1>
 *
 * <p>Entity repositories provide a high-level abstraction for managing entities in the database. They offer a set of
 * methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting entities, as well as querying and filtering entities based on
 * specific criteria. The {@code EntityRepository} interface is designed to work with entity records that implement the
 * {@link Entity} interface, providing a consistent and type-safe way to interact with the database.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Entity Definition</h2>
 * <p>Define the entity records to use them to in combination with repositories. The {@link Entity} interface is a
 * marker interface that indicates that the record is an entity and has a primary key of type {@code ID}. The {@link PK}
 * annotation is used to mark the primary key field of the entity record. The {@link FK} annotation is used to mark
 * the foreign key field of the entity record. The {@link Inline} annotation (optional) is used to mark the record
 * component that is inlined in the entity record.</p>
 *
 * <p>Example:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * record City(@PK int id,
 *             String name,
 *             long population
 * ) implements Entity<Integer> {};
 *
 * record Address(String street, String postalCode, @FK City city)
 *
 * record User(@PK int id,
 *             String email,
 *             LocalDate birthDate,
 *             @Inline Address address
 * ) implements Entity<Integer> {};
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>Repository Lookup</h2>
 * <p>An entity repository can be obtained by invoking {@code entity} on an {@code ORMTemplate} with the desired entity
 * class. The orm template can be requested as demonstrated below. Orm templates are supported for
 * Data Sources and JDBC Connections.</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * ORMTemplate orm = ORMTemplate.of(dataSource);
 * EntityRepository<User> users = orm.entity(User.class);
 * }</pre>
 * <p>Alternatively, a specialized repository can be requested by calling the {@code repository} method with the repository
 * class. Specialized repositories allow specialized repository methods to be defined in the repository interface. The
 * specialized repository can be used to implement specialized queries or operations that are specific to the entity type.
 * The specialized logic can utilize the {@link QueryBuilder} interface to build SELECT and DELETE statements.</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * interface UserRepository extends EntityRepository<User> {
 *
 *     // Specialized repository methods go here:
 *
 *     default Optional<User> findByEmail(String email) {
 *         return select()
 *                 .where(User_.email, EQUALS, email)
 *                 .getOptionalResult();
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * UserRepository userRepository = orm.repository(UserRepository.class)
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>Repository Injection</h2>
 * <p>A specialized repository can also be injected using Spring's dependency injection mechanism when the
 * {@code storm-spring} package is included in the project. Check the storm-spring package to lean how to make
 * repositories available to the application for dependency injection.</p>
 *
 * <h2>CRUD Operations</h2>
 * <p>Entity repositories provide a set of methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting entities in the
 * database. The following sections provide examples of how to use these methods to interact with the database.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Create</h3>
 *
 * <p>Insert a user into the database. The template engine also supports insertion of multiple entries in batch mode by
 * passing a list of entities. Alternatively, insertion can also be executed using a stream of entities.</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * User user = ...;
 * userRepository.insert(user);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h3>Read</h3>
 *
 * <p>Select all users from the database that are linked to cities with the name "Sunnyvale". The static metamodel is
 * used to specify the City entity in the QueryBuilder's entity graph.</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * List<City> cities = cityRepository.findByName("Sunnyvale")
 * List<User> users = userRepository
 *         .select()
 *         .where(User_.address.city, cities) // Type-safe metamodel.
 *         .getResultList();
 * }</pre>
 * <p>Alternatively, {@code getResultStream()} can be invoked to load the users lazily.</p>
 *
 * <p>The QueryBuilder also allows the previous queries to be combined into a single select query, using the
 * User's static metamodel to specify the city name field in the QueryBuilder's entity graph.</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * List<User> users = userRepository
 *         .select()
 *         .where(User_.address.city.name, EQUALS, "Sunnyvale") // Type-safe metamodel.
 *         .getResultList();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h4>Update</h4>
 *
 * <p>Update a user in the database. The repository also supports updates for multiple entries in batch model by passing
 * a list of entities. Alternatively, updates can also be executed using a stream of entities.</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * User user = ...;
 * userRepository.update(user);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h3>Delete</h3>
 *
 * <p>Remove user from the database. The repository also supports removals for multiple entries in batch mode by passing a
 * list entities or primary keys. Alternatively, removal can be executed using a stream of entities.
 * <pre>{@code
 * User user = ...;
 * userRepository.remove(user);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Also here, the QueryBuilder can be used to create specialized statement, for instance, to delete all users where
 * the email field IS NULL.</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * repository
 *         .delete()
 *         .where(User_.email, IS_NULL) // Type-safe metamodel.
 *         .executeUpdate();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @see QueryBuilder
 * @param <E> the type of entity managed by this repository.
 * @param <ID> the type of the primary key of the entity.
